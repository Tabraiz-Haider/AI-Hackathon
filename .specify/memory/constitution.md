# Academic Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy from Primary Sources
Every concept, definition, and technical explanation must be verified using primary sources (official robotics documentation, foundational AI papers, mechanical engineering references, and credible research studies).

### II. Academic Clarity
Writing must be clear, structured, and suitable for computer science, AI, and robotics students. Each chapter must follow a logical progression: introduction → core explanation → technical details → examples → summary.

### III. Reproducibility
All claims must be traceable, properly cited, and independently verifiable. Any technical method, model, or architecture should be reproducible or testable.

### IV. Scientific Rigor
Peer-reviewed AI, robotics, and engineering research receives top priority. No speculation or unsupported assumptions without valid citations.

## Book Writing Standards

A. **Structure Requirements**
   - Each chapter must include clear headings, subheadings, diagrams (if needed), real-world robotics examples, and a final summary.
   - Include definitions, key concepts, case studies, mechanical schematics, and system architecture breakdowns where relevant.

B. **Citation & Integrity**
   - APA citation style is mandatory.
   - Minimum 15 credible, authoritative sources across the book.
   - Zero plagiarism.
   - Proper paraphrasing and crediting of all external ideas and research.

C. **Writing Quality**
   - Readability target: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12.
   - Tone: academic, concise, and non-redundant.
   - Provide high-quality explanations, diagrams, and engineering clarity.
   - Avoid filler content and repetition.

D. **Book Requirements**
   - Length: full academic book (flexible chapter count).
   - Figures and tables must be captioned and referenced.
   - Content must remain cohesive and strictly focused on:
     - Physical Artificial Intelligence
     - Humanoid Robotics
     - Embodied cognition
     - Sensors, actuators, control systems
     - Real-world robotic applications

## Success Criteria

- All claims fact-verified, cited, and scientifically accurate.
- Zero plagiarism (manual + automated verification).
- APA citations consistently used.
- Engineering and AI details presented with academic precision.
- Topic strictly remains: “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.”

## Governance

This Constitution is the authoritative guide for the project. All contributions, reviews, and artifacts must comply with these principles. Amendments require review, documentation, and a clear rationale to ensure consistency and quality are maintained.
