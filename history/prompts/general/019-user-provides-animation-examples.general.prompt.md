## Prompt

Example: Interactive textbook, animated diagrams, GIFs or videos, 3D models, ya slide-based animations.

## Response snapshot

Thank you for these concrete examples of animation types! This greatly clarifies your vision for an animated book.

Given the variety of options you've provided (interactive textbook elements, animated diagrams, GIFs/videos, 3D models, slide-based animations), to make this manageable, could you please tell me:

1.  **Which of these animation types is your top priority or primary focus to implement first?**
2.  **For your chosen priority, can you specify a particular chapter or concept where you'd like to see this animation applied?** For example, if "animated diagrams" is the priority, which specific diagram or process in which chapter would you like to animate?

Once I have this, we can discuss the best approach for integration.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: User provided examples of desired animations. Further clarification needed on priority and specific application.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No files modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user's prioritization of animation types and target content.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user clarified the *types* of animations desired. The next step is to prioritize and identify concrete instances for implementation to manage the scope.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
