## Prompt

There is a language button in the navbar with an Urdu option. When I click on the Urdu option, I want all of my website content to switch to Urdu.

## Response snapshot

I understand. I will re-investigate the translation files by consulting the official Docusaurus documentation to ensure all required translation keys are present. This may reveal if any other missing keys are causing the issue.
