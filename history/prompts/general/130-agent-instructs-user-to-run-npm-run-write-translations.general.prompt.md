## Prompt

There is a language button in the navbar with an Urdu option. When I click on the Urdu option, I want all of my website content to switch to Urdu.

## Response snapshot

I have investigated further into how Docusaurus handles translations. It seems that in addition to the `docusaurus-theme-classic.json` file, there is another important file called `code.json` that handles translations for custom React components.

This `code.json` file is generated by a Docusaurus command. Could you please run the following command in your terminal?

`npm run write-translations`

This command will extract all the translatable text from the website's components and create a `code.json` file in the `i18n/ur` directory.

Once you have run this command, please let me know, and I will inspect the generated file to provide the necessary Urdu translations.
