## Prompt

Mysterious black hardcover book with glowing crimson edges floating in darkness, faint smoke and ember particles, book opens dramatically with red glow spilling from pages, blood-red runes appear then morph into title "[BOOK TITLE]" in gothic font, ultra detailed, moody cinematic lighting, silent, vertical 9:16 --ar 9:16 --v 6 --q 2 --style raw

## Response snapshot

I understand you're providing another highly detailed visual animation prompt, complete with parameters for image/video generation AIs.

As I've explained, my capabilities are focused on software engineering tasks—generating and modifying code, and setting up projects. I cannot:

*   Generate or render complex 3D animations or high-quality video files.
*   Perform visual design tasks using specialized animation software.
*   Process images or integrate specific visual effects to produce such a deliverable.

This kind of request falls outside my current scope as a code-focused agent.

Could you please clarify your intent? Are you looking for:

1.  Assistance with implementing a code-based animation *within your Docusaurus project* that attempts to mimic some of these visual ideas (to the extent possible with web technologies)?
2.  Or are you simply using me to store these detailed animation prompts?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: User provided another detailed animation prompt. Still out of scope. Re-explaining limitations and seeking intent clarification.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No files modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user's clarification on intent (code-based vs. prompt storage).
- 🧠 Reflection: The user provided yet another visual animation prompt. It's crucial to confirm if they wish for code-based assistance for animation within their project, or if they are using the agent to store these detailed prompts.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
