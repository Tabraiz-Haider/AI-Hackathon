## Prompt

(Implicit task: add headings above chapter buttons)

## Response snapshot

I have updated the todo list. Now, I will create a PHR for the user's implicit confirmation to proceed (given "task diya hai wo karo").

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully added headings above chapter buttons in hero section cards.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Modified index.tsx.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Adjusting hover text color.
- 🧠 Reflection: Interpreted user's ambiguous request as adding headings above existing clickable buttons and successfully implemented this, ensuring proper structure for Docusaurus i18n.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Ambiguity in user instruction could lead to incorrect implementation.
- Graders run and results (if applicable): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
