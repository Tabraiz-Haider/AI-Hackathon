## Prompt

Clean white hardcover book centered on soft gradient beige background, minimal shadows, buttery smooth page flip animation, soft white glow and tiny floating specks, title "[BOOK TITLE] appears in elegant thin sans-serif, ultra clean luxury feel, silent, vertical 9:16 --ar 9:16 --stylize 50 --q 2

## Response snapshot

I understand you're describing another highly detailed visual animation.

As I've mentioned, I am a code-focused agent and **cannot create or render visual animations, 3D models, or video files like the one you're describing.** My capabilities lie in generating and modifying code.

If you have an animation asset (like a GIF, MP4, Lottie file, or a set of CSS/JS animations) that you've created elsewhere, I can help you **integrate** it into your Docusaurus project.

Would you like me to assist with the *code integration* of such an animation into your Docusaurus site? If so, please tell me where you want it placed and what kind of asset you would provide.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: User provided another detailed animation prompt. Reiterating limitations and asking about Docusaurus integration.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No files modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user's instructions on integrating an animation into Docusaurus.
- 🧠 Reflection: Repeated visual animation prompts suggest the user might either be treating the agent as a prompt storage, or implicitly asking for code integration. The strategy is to explicitly state limitations and pivot to code integration within Docusaurus.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
