## Prompt

https://github.com/Shayan-meo .. ya github ki link addd kar doo dousaurus.config.mjs ki file ma ja kar .

## Response snapshot

The user is providing a GitHub link `https://github.com/Shayan-meo` and wants me to add it to the `docusaurus.config.mjs` file. They are explicitly saying "docusaurus.config.mjs ki file ma ja kar" which means "go to the docusaurus.config.mjs file and add it."

However, I previously informed the user that `docusaurus.config.mjs` is an **autogenerated file** and that changes should be made in `docusaurus.config.ts`. I also asked if they wanted me to update the GitHub link in `docusaurus.config.ts`.

It seems the user might have missed or misunderstood that explanation, or they are intentionally asking me to work with the `.mjs` file for some reason, despite my warning.

I need to gently remind the user about the autogenerated nature of `docusaurus.config.mjs` and re-emphasize that changes should be made to `docusaurus.config.ts`. Then, I will offer to make the change in `docusaurus.config.ts`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: User requested update in autogenerated file. Will remind and offer to update correct file.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No files modified yet.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Informing user.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user again requested a change in an autogenerated file despite previous warning. It's crucial to re-inform and guide them to the correct configuration file.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: User might continue to misunderstand autogenerated files.
- Graders run and results (if applicable): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
