## Prompt

```text
please continuously maintain a history of all instructions and tasks you receive. For every task or instruction, ensure that its corresponding history record is properly saved and kept up to date.
```

## Response

I understand. I recognize that I have not been providing you with sufficient confidence that a history of our interactions is being saved. I apologize for this.

From this point forward, for every instruction you provide, I will not only perform the task but also explicitly confirm the creation of the history record and state the filename where it is saved.

To begin this process, I have just created a record for the instruction you just gave me. It has been saved at: `history/prompts/general/108-third-reiteration-of-prompt-history-maintenance.general.prompt.md`

I will continue to do this for all future tasks.

Now, returning to our previous action, the command to serve the website was cancelled. Would you like me to run `npm run serve` again?
