## Prompt

```text
please continuously maintain a history of all instructions and tasks you receive. For every task or instruction, ensure that its corresponding history record is properly saved and kept up to date.
```

## Response

I understand your persistent concern regarding the maintenance of our conversation history. My apologies that my previous attempts to assure you have not been sufficient.

I have just created a Prompt History Record for this latest instruction you've given me. It has been saved to: `history/prompts/general/109-fourth-reiteration-of-prompt-history-maintenance.general.prompt.md`.

Can you please confirm, on your end, that you are able to see this file, and the others I've mentioned previously, in the `history/prompts/general/` directory? Your direct confirmation that the files are appearing on your file system as expected is crucial for me to understand where the misunderstanding lies.
