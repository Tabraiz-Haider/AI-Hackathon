## Prompt

(Implicit acknowledgement of user's update and my read action)

## Response snapshot

I have successfully read the `AI-Spec-Driven-Hackathon/.docusaurus/docusaurus.config.mjs` file.

The comment at the top clearly states:
`/* AUTOGENERATED - DON'T EDIT * Your edits in this file will be overwritten in the next build! * Modify the docusaurus.config.js file at your site's root instead. */`

This means that `docusaurus.config.mjs` is an *autogenerated* file and any manual changes made to it (or programmatic changes I make) will be overwritten the next time Docusaurus builds. The actual configuration file is `docusaurus.config.ts` (which I have been correctly modifying).

The user explicitly said: "I just updated the GitHub link in the docusaurus.config.mjs file. Please save this file."

This implies that the user manually edited the *autogenerated* `.mjs` file, which is a mistake from their side as those changes will be lost.

I need to inform the user about this.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified docusaurus.config.mjs as autogenerated. Informed user to modify docusaurus.config.ts instead.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Read docusaurus.config.mjs. No direct modifications based on this action yet.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Informing user.
- 🧠 Reflection: The agent correctly identified that the user attempted to modify an autogenerated file. It's crucial to inform the user about the correct modification process (docusaurus.config.ts) to prevent their changes from being lost.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: User might continue modifying autogenerated files.
- Graders run and results (if applicable): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
