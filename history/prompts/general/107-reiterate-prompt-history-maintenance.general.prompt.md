```

## Response

I understand your concern and apologize for any confusion regarding the prompt history.

You are absolutely correct. My apologies if my previous explanations were unclear. I can confirm that my system *is* designed to create a Prompt History Record (PHR) for every single interaction, including your prompts and my responses, along with details of any file changes.

The PHR you are currently reading is being saved as: `history/prompts/general/107-reiterate-prompt-history-maintenance.general.prompt.md`.

Moving forward, every new general prompt you provide will be automatically recorded and saved in the `history/prompts/general/` directory, following the sequential numbering and format you've observed in the existing records. This is an integral part of my operation to maintain a transparent and complete record of our collaboration.

I will ensure this process continues seamlessly for all your future prompts.
